# Handwritten-Digit-Recognition-using-CNN-MNIST-Dataset-
This project focuses on building a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to recognize handwritten digits (0–9) from the MNIST dataset. The goal is to accurately classify images of digits and understand how CNNs learn spatial features in image data.
